# ALX BACKEND

This repository contains a set of small backend projects and exercises used for learning and practicing common backend concepts in Python and Node.js. Each subfolder is a standalone exercise or mini-project covering a focused topic (pagination, caching, i18n, and a Redis-backed queuing system).

## Contents

- `0x00-pagination/` â€” Python exercises that demonstrate dataset pagination techniques (simple pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-resilient pagination).
- `0x01-caching/` â€” Python implementations of different cache replacement policies (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU) and a `base_caching.py` helper.
- `0x02-i18n/` â€” A Flask application and templates that demonstrate internationalization (i18n) using Flask-Babel. Includes translation files and examples of locale negotiation.
- `0x03-queuing_system_in_js/` â€” A Node.js project that demonstrates using Redis and Kue to build a simple queuing system, plus example Express integration and tests.

Each folder contains its own README with learning objectives and resources. See the folder README files for the theory behind each exercise.
